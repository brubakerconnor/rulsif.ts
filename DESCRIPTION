Description: rulsif.ts implements relative unconstrained least squares importance fitting for
    the task of detecting change points in time series data. The main function is ts_detect which
    automatically creates a matrix of subsequences of the series and associates to each time point
    a "score" from which change points may be detected. A plotting function, ts_detect_plot, 
    visualizes one-dimensional series, scores, and highlights change point candidates given a threshold.
    The functions in comp_dist.R, comp_median.R, gaussian_kernel.R, RelULSIF.R, and 
    sigma_lambda_grid_search.R were originally written in MATLAB by Song Liu.
